# Unclosed Image Tag in Dynamically Generated HTML

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed `<img>` tag within dynamically generated content.  The issue arises when JavaScript manipulates the DOM and inserts HTML that is not properly formatted. This can lead to validation errors and unexpected rendering behavior in browsers.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, where the closing tag for the image is missing. The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected version.

**Problem:** The dynamically added `<img>` tag lacks the closing `</img>` tag, causing validation problems and potential layout issues.

**Solution:** Ensure all HTML tags are properly closed, even those dynamically inserted using JavaScript.   Always validate your HTML to catch these errors.
